# Game-of-Connect-Four
The above game is in Java language.
2 players can play the game.
Player can select the colour as 'red' or 'yellow'

while running the code, we have to pass the value of row and column and the piece.
Example:-
          javac Code.java
          java Code 5 7 2   ////where row is 5, column is 7 and the piece is 2
                            //// piece represent count of 'r' or 'y' common consequencly and that player is the winner

| | | | | | | |

| | | | | | | |

| | | | | | | |

|y|y| | | | | |

|r|r|r| | | | |


here Piece is 3 so the 'r' count is 3 so the player red is the winner
